# Framework ALFAA

This repository contains data and codes for the prototype based on the framework ALFAA (Active Learning Fingerprint-based Anti Aliasing) to correct developer identity errors in version control data. The details of this framework can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03363

### Data
crossRaterRelibility.clean.txt - Data provided to raters to create labels. These labels are used to compute agreement between raters.

### Code  
rf.r - Models and cross-validation. Effects of augmenting fingerprint metrics to string similarity.
.pbs, test_pmclust.R - codes for running on distributed
